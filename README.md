# 🔐 PortSwigger Labs Exploitation – SQLi, XSS, SSRF & More

This repository contains my personal solutions and write-ups for a wide range of **PortSwigger Web Security Academy** labs, focusing on:

- ✅ SQL Injection (Boolean-based, Time-based, Error-based, Out-of-Band)
- ✅ Cross-Site Scripting (Reflected, Stored, DOM-Based)
- ✅ Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- ✅ Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- ✅ Broken Authentication and more...

## 📁 What’s inside?

Each lab includes:
- 🎯 A brief description of the lab's objective

Also included:
- 🧰 Custom Python automation scripts (e.g., blind SQLi extractor)
